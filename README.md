This is a medium-sized project I'm working on that will hopefully auto-generate a city with a random layout.

~~~TODO~~~
1. Update river algorith to make it more visually interesting
2. More building types
3. More interesting roads
4. Backgrounds that aren't just white or blue
5. More interesting bridges
